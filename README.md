What is a binary tree   
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree   
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists   
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree    
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree  
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree   

## Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Donâ€™t forget to include them in your header file.  

Basic Binary Tree  
```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};
typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```
### Binary Search Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```
### AVL Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```
### Max Binary Heap
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```
